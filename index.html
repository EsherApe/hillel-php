                        <p>The <b>Internet</b> is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web
                            possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all
                            together.</p>

                            Internet</a> is
                            somewhat obscure. It began in the 1960s as a US-army-funded research project, then evolved into
                            a public infrastructure in the 1980s with the support of many public universities and private
                            companies. The various technologies that support the Internet have evolved over time, but the
                            way it works hasn't changed that much: Internet is a way to connect computers all together and
                            ensure that, whatever happens, they find a way to stay connected.</p>

                            <p>When two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically (usually
                                with an Ethernet cable) or wirelessly (for example with WiFi or Bluetooth systems). All
                                modern computers can sustain any of those connections.</p>

                            <img src="img/internet-schema-1.png" alt="simple internet schema" class="section__img">

                            <p>Such a network is not limited to two computers. You can connect as many computers as you
                                wish. But it gets complicated quickly. If you're trying to connect, say, ten computers, you
                                need 45 cables, with nine plugs per computer!</p>

                            <img src="img/internet-schema-2.png" alt="internet schema" class="section__img">

                            <p>To solve this problem, each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer
                                called a router. This router has only one job: like a signaler at a railway station, it
                                makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination
                                computer. To send a message to computer B, computer A must send the message to the router,
                                which in turn forwards the message to computer B and makes sure the message is not delivered
                                to computer C.</p>

                            <p>Once we add a router to the system, our network of 10 computers only requires 10 cables: a
                                single plug for each computer and a router with 10 plugs.</p>

                            <p>So far so good. But what about connecting hundreds, thousands, billions of computers? Of
                                course a single router can't scale that far, but, if you read carefully, we said that a
                                router is a computer like any other, so what keeps us from connecting two routers together?
                                Nothing, so let's do that.</p>

                            <img src="img/internet-schema-4.png" alt="internet schema" class="section__img">

                            <p>By connecting computers to routers, then routers to routers, we are able to scale
                                infinitely.</p>

                            <img src="img/internet-schema-5.png" alt="internet schema" class="section__img">

                            <p>Such a network comes very close to what we call the Internet, but we're missing something. We
                                built that network for our own purposes. There are other networks out there: your friends,
                                your neighbors, anyone can have their own network of computers. But it's not really possible
                                to set cables up between your house and the rest of the world, so how can you handle this?
                                Well, there are already cables linked to your house, for example, electric power and
                                telephone. The telephone infrastructure already connects your house with anyone in the world
                                so it is the perfect wire we need. To connect our network to the telephone infrastructure,
                                we need a special piece of equipment called a modem. This modem turns the information from
                                our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.</p>

                            <img src="img/internet-schema-6.png" alt="internet schema" class="section__img">

                            <p>So we are connected to the telephone infrastructure. The next step is to send the messages
                                from our network to the network we want to reach. To do that, we will connect our network to
                                an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An ISP is a company that manages some special routers
                                that link all together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our
                                network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network. The
                                Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.</p>

                            <p>If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one. Thus any computer
                                linked to a network has a unique address to identify it, called an "IP address" (where IP
                                stands for Internet Protocol). It's an address made of a series of four numbers separated by
                                dots, for example: 192.168.2.10.</p>

                            <p>That's perfectly fine for computers, but we human beings have a hard time remembering that
                                sort of address. To make things easier, we can alias an IP address with a human readable
                                name called a domain name. For example, google.com is the domain name used on top of the IP
                                address 173.194.121.32. So using the domain name is the easiest way for us to reach a
                                computer over the Internet.</p>

                            <h3 class="section__sub-title">Internet and the web</h3>

                            <p>As you might notice, when we browse the Web with a Web browser, we usually use the domain
                                name to reach a website. Does that mean the Internet and the Web are the same thing? It's
                                not that simple. As we saw, the Internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions
                                of computers to be connected all together. Among those computers, some computers (called Web
                                servers) can send messages intelligible to web browsers. The Internet is an infrastructure,
                                whereas the Web is a service built on top of the infrastructure. It is worth noting there
                                are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and IRC.</p>
