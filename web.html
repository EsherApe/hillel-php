                        <p>Computers connected to the Web are called clients and servers. A simplified diagram of how
                            they
                            interact might look like this:</p>

                            <li>Clients are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your
                                computer
                                connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and

                                software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).

                            <li>Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to
                                access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client
                                machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.

                            parts involved, and we'll describe them below.</p>

                        <p>For now, let's imagine that the Web is a road. On one end of the road is the client, which is
                            like your house. On the other end of the road is the server, which is a shop you want to buy
                            something from.</p>

                            <li><b>Your Internet connection:</b> Allows you to send and receive data on the Web. It's
                                basically like the street between your house and the shop.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>TCP/IP:</b> Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication
                                protocols that define how data should travel across the Web. This is like the transport
                                mechanisms that let you to place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our
                                example, this is like a car or a bike (or your own two feet).

                            <li><b>DNS:</b> Domain Name System Servers are like an address book for websites. When you
                                type
                                a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS before retrieving the
                                website.
                                The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP
                                messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the address of the shop
                                so
                                you can access it.

                            <li><b>HTTP:</b> Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a
                                language
                                for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to
                                order
                                your goods.

                            <li><b>Component files:</b> A website is made up of many different files, which are like the
                                different
                                parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Code files:</b> Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                                        though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.

                                    <li><b>Assets:</b> This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a
                                        website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.

                                data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection

                                sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data

                            your
                            favorite websites. They are strings of numbers, like this: 63.245.217.105.</p>

                        <p>This is called an IP address, and it represents a unique location on the Web. However, it's
                            not
                            very easy to remember, is it? That's why Domain Name Servers were invented. These are
                            special
                            servers that match up a web address you type into your browser (like "mozilla.org") to the
                            website's real (IP) address.</p>

                        <p>Websites can be reached directly via their IP addresses. Try going to the Mozilla website by
                            typing 63.245.217.105 into the address bar on a new browser tab.</p>

                        <p>Earlier we used the term "packets" to describe the format in which the data is sent from
                            server
                            to client. What do we mean here? Basically, when data is sent across the Web, it is sent as
                            thousands of small chunks, so that many different web users can download the same website at
                            the
                            same time. If web sites were sent as single big chunks, only one user could download one at
                            a
                            time, which obviously would make the Web very inefficient and not much fun to use.</p>
